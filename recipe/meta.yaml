  summary: Generate documentation from source code

  description: |
    Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for
    generating documentation from annotated C++ sources,
    but it also supports other popular programming
    languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java,
    Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors),
    Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.
